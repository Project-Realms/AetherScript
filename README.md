<h2>Instructions to Install:</h2>
<li>Open Terminal in your desired Folder and Clone this Repository.</li>

```
git clone https://github.com/ProjectDragonRealms/AetherScript.git
```
<li>Open the Cloned Folder and Click on "AetherX" folder.</li>

``` AetherScript >> AetherX ```

<li>Either Run "AES.py" or "EmberLaunch.py" through either Terminal or Python Default IDE.</li>
Open Terminal in "AetherX" Folder, and execute either one of these Commands:

``` python3 EmberLaunch.py ```
Or
``` python3 AES.py ```
, You could execute Aether Script by opening either "AES.py" or "EmberLaunch.py" in Default Python IDE and pressing F5.

<li>Once Opened, enjoy your Time Developing!</li>

<h2>Documentations:</h2>
<h3>Aether Terminal - Chamber</h3>

Once the Aether Script is executed, ``` <AetherScript> ``` Prompt appears, this is where you work with the Script. And this work area is known as a Aether Chamber.


<h3>Built-In Functions:</h3>

- Write: Write function is used to Execute text syntax through following Command: ``` Write("Hello World") ``` , where Text inside Double-inverted Commas are Executed.
- Operations: In the Chamber, you can perform Binary Operations i.e Addition, Substraction, Multipliation and Division.. For Instance, ``` 2*3 ```,``` 1+2```, ```24-12```, ```121/11 ```, And you could even work with Brackets!
- Null: A Function having no Value.
- True and False: Declaring Conditions with True and False Functions (Under Development)
- Mathematical Symbols and Values: Symbols like less than ```<``` and greater than ```>``` help in Classification of values of Variables and comparing them. ``` ! ``` is characterised as Not Equal to symbol. Values like ```MathPi``` can be used to calculate certain things. Execution of ```MathPi``` Function in Chamber gives Value of π
- Strings: In Aether Script, String can be declared by ``` " ``` Symbol infront of Character. (Can be used for single Character - Under Development.)
- Comments: In Aether Script, comments can be added in Script by ``` ~ ``` symbol. (Single line Comment)
- Decimal: In Numeric Values, Decimal point ``` . ``` can be added and perform Operations.
- NewLine: New line can be added by ```->``` function to classify the code.
- Classification of Characters: Aether Script classifies the code into Illegal and Accurate Values. Error in Code will be informed to revise it. Any misplaced character is often suggested to correct.
- Function: ```Function``` command is used to  declare a Function i.e. a Prefix, Element or a Character. (Partially Developed)
- Variable: ```Variable``` function is used to declare a value for further usage. (Under Development)
- Run: ``` Run ``` Function can be used to executes a ```.aes``` file, that is - AetherScript Format file. A Aetherscript format file can be executed by ```Run("FILENAME.aes")``` command in Chamber.

<h3>Writing a separate AetherScript:</h3>

1. Open your IDE or a Default Text Editor.
2. Write your Aether Script prompt.
3. Save it as a ```.aes``` format file.
4. Open "AES.py" or "EmberLaunch.py" to get into Aether Chamber, then Use the ```Run``` function to execute the AetherScript. That is, ```<AetherScript> Run("FILENAME.aes")```

<h3>An Example:</h3>

```
Write("Hello World")

~ This is a Comment and now we will find Circumference of Circle i.e 2πr with 10cm as Radius

Write(2*MathPi*10)

~ Now we will perform a Binary Operation

Write(2*6.42*24/12*2+100)
```
Result:
```
<AetherScript> Run("Aether.aes")
Hello World
62.83185307179586
151.35999999999999
0
<AetherScript>
```
